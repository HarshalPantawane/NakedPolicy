⚠️ The AI can make up facts or give wrong information, and the company is not legally responsible for any harm that causes.
⚠️ They track which websites you came from before using their service and what you do on their site.
⚠️ If the company is sold or goes bankrupt, your private data can be sold to the new owners as an asset.
